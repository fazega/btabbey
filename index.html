                <p>Greetings, brother. I sense you're here about the bishop's disappearance. These are troubling times indeed.</p>
                <p>Before the bishop vanished, he spent much time in the crypt, studying ancient manuscripts. He spoke of finding something that would change everything - something about the cathedral's true purpose.</p>
                <p>There were whispers of conflict between the bishop and the master mason. The bishop wanted to incorporate certain... unconventional elements into the cathedral's design. Elements that some considered heretical.</p>
                <p>I've heard rumors that the bishop's chambers were found in disarray, with strange symbols drawn on the walls. The master mason's guild has been unusually quiet about the whole affair.</p>
